              genesis of this Institute was the memorandum of Settlement on

              Government, the Union Government and the Bodo Liberation Tigers,
              on February 10, 2003, in New Delhi. The Institute is an autonomous
              body registered under the Societies Registration Act., 1860 and
              functions under a Board of Governors (BOG).

              efforts being made by the Government of India and the Government
              of Assam to fulfill the aspirations of the Bodo people. It is thus

              education in the country through its modular and innovative
              academic programmes.
